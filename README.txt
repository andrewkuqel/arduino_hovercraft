 HOVERCRAFT DESIGN PROJECT

This is the introductory file regarding the Arduino programming portion of the Hovercraft Project.

The programming portion will be mainly written by Andrew Nicholson and Luke Herman.

Our read.me file should have additional humor, however we are clearly stumped in that department as we are soulless bots that are trapped in the GitHub GUI.
